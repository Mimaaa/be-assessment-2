## Heroku

I'm using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) to deploy my server in combination with the [Heroku PostgreSQL instance](https://www.heroku.com/postgres). 

This repo is connected to Heroku, so all the changes are deployed instantly.
# Installation

## Scripts

```sh
$ npm start
```

To watch file changes through nodemon use:
```sh
$ npm run watch
```

To check your code on linting errors use:
